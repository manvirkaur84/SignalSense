<h1>Test Information</h1>

Our model was trained into a PyTorch model, and then converted to an ONNX model. It was converted into an IR model after that. So each model format was tested according to the following:
- accuracy rate
- accurate bounding boxes
- inference speed 

You can find the test images in each format below.
